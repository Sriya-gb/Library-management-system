# Library-management-system
Library management project is about creating a computer based features & operations for a manual book library for monitoring & controlling the daily transaction.
We have created this project by using Python ( primary coding language) & MySQL ( database) – a GUI ( Graphic user interface) is there for interfacing different modules.
Project has got two primary modules – 1 ) Admin / Librarian side functions 2) User/student side functions.
The admin side function includes basic operations e.g. Add/Delete books, search/view books, Issue/Return.
The user side function includes add member, book information, browse book history, , requisition request.
The database system used is Ms SQL for creating backend data- base based on E-R ( Entity Relationship ) diagram. 
Systems can be operative in windows – however can be scaled up to operate in Linux, MacOS & other platforms. It can also be made web based system to be accessed from anywhere.
